# Web-Scraper
This module integrates with a language model (via LangChain and OllamaLLM) to parse and extract specific information from provided text content. It defines the function parse_with_ollama which:   1. Accepts chunks of DOM content and a extraction description.   2. Constructs a prompt with instructions and feeds it to the language model.
